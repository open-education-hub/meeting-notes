## TODOs and Decisions

- Have someone do communication: social media posts, noise making, popularize project results.

- Have some survey and collect call information and potential funding sources.
  Then engage people in writing grant proposals to attract funding.

- Think whether there are ways in which we can lower the Git learning curve to foster adoption.

- TODO GM: Collect ideas (as GitHub issues) on simplifying vmchecker flows.

- TODO VN + TD: Collect ideas (as GitHub issues) on improving `openedu-builder`.

- TODO SJ: Collect ideas (as GitHub issues) on improving quiz management.

- TODO TD: Direct the full upgrade of `operating-systems` contents to the [OpenEdu methodoology](https://open-education-hub.github.io/methodology/).

- We need an FAQ with common errors for `openedu-builder`.

- Owners of future content conversion to OpenEdu:

  - SO: TD
  - IOCLA: TD
  - USO: SW
  - SCGC: SW
  - CNS: ES/RD
  - RL: Gabi
  - SIS: RD (and Rareș Visalom)
