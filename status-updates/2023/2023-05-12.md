## Discussions

### Social Media

LB: I made a bunch of posts these past few days and we got a few more followers and reactions.
Most of them are from UPB.

RN: This is just our first step.
To get more reach, we'll have to pay social media platforms.
We might want to consider this in the future.

### Press Release

RN: I spoke to RD about the press release article, but he keeps postponing me.

### Security Summer School

TD: Let's award SmileyCoins for CTFs.

SW: Let's also add physical prizes.

RN: Let's add prices for SSS merchandise and allow students to buy them with SMLY.
We need SSS to be structured better.

### Methodology and Infrastructure

RN: I'll start working on the methodology article.
We've been using the methodology constantly.
All we need is to centralise it.

RN: What will be the output of our infrastructure?

SW: The applications.
We can also mention the UPB deployment.

RN: Can we have an executable which you can just click and that deploys the whole infrastructure?

SW: No.
We're targeting IT education.
The users are supposed to be able to run a script.

### TODOs and Decisions

TD: Let's bring Gabi Mocanu to our next meeting and discuss the Security Summer School content.
