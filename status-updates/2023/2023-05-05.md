## Agenda

* What should people do to host their materials under OpenEducationHub?

## Participants

RăzvanD, Sergiu, Teo, RăzvanN, Liza, Vlad, Mihai

## Discussions

### Weekly Posts

RD: Liza, make weekly posts on our social media about anything: articles, other work, our work etc.

### GitLab vs GitHub

RD: We will maybe use GitLab more than GitHub in the future thanks to its richer features.
The problem is that GitHub is more popular.

### Marketing

RN: We have no marketing.
Let's go to workshops.
`vmchecker-next` may be an article in itself.
The methodology repo is similar, but we have no metrics.

RD: If we target a broad audience, they will be excited in the moment and their enthusiasm dies down immediately.
Let's pick 5-6 people and meet with them periodically.

LB: Let's help Garbiela Ciuprina port her course to OER because she wants it, whereas others don't even want to.

### Infrastructure Paper

SW: I tried writing the articles and the state of the art is mostly lacking.
Teaching papers are difficult to find and it's also difficult to find metrics.

RD: Let's discuss metrics in 2 weeks.

RD: We have 400 assignments for OS for the infrastructure paper.

### TODOs and Decisions

TD: RazvanD's first `TODO` item is [last week's meeting notes](https://github.com/open-education-hub/meeting-notes/pull/1).
